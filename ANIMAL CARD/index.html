            <p>The German Shepherd, also known in     Britain as an Alsatian, is a German breed     of working dog of medium to large size. The     breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz     using various traditional German herding     dogs from 1899. It was originally bred as a     herding dog, for herding sheep.</p>
